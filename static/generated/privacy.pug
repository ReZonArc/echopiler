    h2 Compiler Explorer Privacy Policy

    p
      | Thanks for your interest in what Compiler Explorer does with your data. Data protection is really
      | important to the Compiler Explorer team, and we want to be very clear about what we do with your data.

    h4 Your data

    ul
      li #[strong Code] is stored temporarily while we compile it, then deleted within minutes.
      li #[strong Shared links] store your code indefinitely if you create short URLs (full links don't store anything server-side).
      li #[strong Web logs] contain semi-anonymised IP addresses, and are kept for up to one month.
      li #[strong Error reports] - we may keep your code for up to a week if needed for debugging (you can opt out of this).
      li #[strong Third parties] only receive data with your explicit consent.

    h4 How long we keep things

    ul
      li #[strong Your source code] is usually deleted within minutes, or (unless you opt out) up to 1 week if we need it for debugging.
      li #[strong Shared links] that use the shortened form are kept indefinitely (but can be deleted on request).
      li #[strong Web logs] contain semi-anonymised IP addresses for up to 1 month.
      li #[strong Amazon logs] contain full IP addresses for up to 1 month.
      li #[strong Error reports] hold IP and browser info for up to 90 days.

    h3 Who we are

    p
      | Compiler Explorer was created by and is primarily administrated by
      |
      a(href="mailto:matt@godbolt.org") Matt Godbolt
      | , along with a number of volunteers (including, but not limited to those listed in our "
      a(href="https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer/blob/main/AUTHORS.md"
        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener") Authors
      | " documentation).
      | It is run on a best-effort basis, and is not a commercial product. We do our best
      | to keep your data safe, but welcome help from the community: See our
      |
      a(href="https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer"
        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener") GitHub project page
      |
      | if you wish to help.

    h3 Your data

    h4 What happens when you compile code

    p
      | When you compile, your browser sends your source code and compiler settings to our servers. We write your code
      | to a temporary file, run the compiler on it, and send the results back to your browser.

    p
      | #[strong Your code is deleted within minutes.] As soon as compilation finishes, we clean up the temporary files.

    p
      | #[strong Exception for debugging:] If something goes wrong with Compiler Explorer itself (not your code, but our
      | system), we might keep your code for up to a week to help us fix the problem. This only happens if you have the
      | "Allow my source code to be temporarily stored for diagnostic purposes" setting enabled (which it is by default).
      | You can disable this in Settings if you prefer. Only the Compiler Explorer team can access this, and we'll never
      | share your code with anyone else.

    h4 How we speed things up (caching)

    p
      | To make repeated compilations faster, we cache the results.

    p
      | We create a unique fingerprint from your code and settings using a secure hash. We cannot reconstruct
      | your original code from this fingerprint. However, we do store the compilation results (the assembly or executable
      | output) as plain text, linked to that fingerprint.

    p
      | Part of this cache lives in memory and disappears when we restart our servers. Part of it is stored on shared disk. In
      | exceptional cases, Compiler Explorer administrators might be able to see these cached compilation results, but
      | there's no way for us to trace them back to the original source code.

    h4 Short links

    p
      | If you choose to share your code using the "Share" dropdown, then the user interface state including the source code
      | is stored. For a "Full" link, this information is encoded into the URL as a URL hash (e.g.
      | #[code https://godbolt.org/#ui_state_and_code]). For short URLs, the interface state is stored on
      | Compiler Explorer's servers, and a shortened name uniquely
      | referring to this data is returned. The shortened name comes from a secure hash of the state, and without
      | knowing the name it is infeasible to access the data. Only Compiler Explorer administrators can access this data
      | directly. Obfuscated IP addresses and creation time are stored alongside this data, to enable spam detection.
      | Links of this form look like #[code https://godbolt.org/z/SHORTNAME].

    p
      | Before September 2018, Compiler Explorer used Google's goo.gl service for short links.
      | We switched to our own system in 2018, but when Google shut down goo.gl in 2025, we migrated any remaining old
      | links to ensure they keep working.

    h4 Application, web and error logs

    p
      | We keep two types of logs:

    p
      | Web access logs contain semi-anonymised IP addresses but no other personal information.
      | When you visit a long Compiler Explorer URL (the ones with #[code #] in them), your code
      | stays in your browser and isn't logged. If you visit a short URL we created (like #[code godbolt.org/z/abc123]),
      | then we can potentially retrieve your code from our logs.

    p
      | Compilation logs are separate analytics logs that record which compilers and settings people use,
      | but don't contain any code or other sensitive information.

    p
      | Amazon infrastructure logs: We use Amazon's servers to run Compiler Explorer. Their logs (which help us
      | debug issues and block attacks) contain full IP addresses and are kept for up to one month, then permanently
      | deleted.

    p
      | For error reporting: If something goes wrong in your browser, we use
      |
      a(href="https://sentry.io/" target="_blank") Sentry
      |
      | to help us fix it. This keeps your IP address and browser information for up to 90 days.

    h4 Executing your code

    p
      | For certain configurations, we may support executing the results of your compilation on the Compiler Explorer
      | servers. Execution occurs in a heavily locked-down, isolated environment. We have made reasonable efforts to protect
      | both the Compiler Explorer site and other concurrently-processed requests from information leakage due to rogue
      | executions.

    h4 Claude Explain

    p
      | The "Claude Explain" view sends your code and data to Anthropic, the makers of Claude. We always ask for consent
      | before sending your code, and Anthropic does not use anything we send them for training. For the purposes of
      | Anthropic's own Privacy Policy, we use them as a "data processor", and so our own privacy policy applies to the
      | data.

    h4 Cookies

    p
      | Compiler Explorer uses small pieces of information stored on your computer: Cookies and Browser Local
      | Storage (and Session Storage). Local storage remembers your settings, source code and user interface configuration
      | so it's available when you visit again. This information is not transmitted to
      | Compiler Explorer, except as described above in order to fulfil your requests. There is a
      |
      a(href="#cookies" rel="noreferrer noopener") separate document
      |
      | covering more on this.

    h3 Your rights and choices

    h4 What you can control

    p
      | You decide if and when to create shared links. In case of an emergency you can request
      | deletion by contacting us.

    p
      | For Claude Explain, we always ask for your explicit consent before sending any code to Anthropic.

    p
      | Compiler Explorer is open source. If you prefer complete control over your data,
      | you can run your own instance. Instructions are on our
      |
      a(href="https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer"
        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener") GitHub project page
      | .

    h4 Data requests

    p
      | If you have questions about your data or want to request deletion of a shared link, contact us at
      |
      a(href="mailto:privacy@compiler-explorer.com") privacy@compiler-explorer.com
      | .

    h3 Compiler Explorer and the GDPR

    p
      | We comply with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) because:

    ul
      li We don't collect or store permanently identifying personal information
      li IP addresses in logs are semi-anonymised and deleted within one month
      li Your source code is processed temporarily and then deleted

    h4 Name and contact details of the controller

    p
      | The Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws
      | applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is:
