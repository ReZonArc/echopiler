        | Claude Explain will send your #[b source code] and #[b compilation output] to #[a(href="https://www.anthropic.com/" target="_blank") Anthropic]
        | (an external API), and will use a large language model (LLM, a form of AI) to attempt to explain your code and the assembly output it produces.
      p LLMs can be useful but can make mistakes and can sound confident even when they're wrong.
      p
        | The data sent to Claude is #[b not] collected or used by Anthropic to train their model, and remains private to Compiler Explorer,
        | and is covered by our Privacy Policy.
